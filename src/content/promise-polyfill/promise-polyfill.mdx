## Implement Promise polyfill

[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

### Question

Create a class `Promise` with two constructor parameters: `resolve` (fired when the promise is resolved) and `reject` (fired when the promise is rejected).
This implementation must contain a `then` method (called upon completion) and a `catch` method (called upon failure). The methods must be chainable, that is,
you can call `catch` right after `then`, or vise-versa, and it will yield the same result. There's no limit on how many `then` or `catch` calls you can chain.

```text
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  resolve(5)
})
.then(function(results) {
  console.log(results);
})
.catch(function(error) {
  console.error(error);
})
```

### Thought process Pseudocode

1. A good way to start is by defining the Promise interface and it's operations. You can use a class (ES6) or function constructor:

```javascript
function Promise(callback) {
  // ...code
}
```

2. Consider what should happen if the promise is already _resolved_, that is, the `resolved` function was already called.

### Solution

```javascript
// TODO: solution...
```

### Caveat

Both the `then` and `catch` functions return promises, which will call the next `then` or `catch` function that follows in the chain.
